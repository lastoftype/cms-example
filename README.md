# CMS Project

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

This is a work in progress... Just creating a fresh CMS with a few basic styles based on some Dribble examples. 

Adding Redux, API, etc. as I go.

## Install
```bash
$ yarn install
```

## Run app
```bash
$ yarn start
```
